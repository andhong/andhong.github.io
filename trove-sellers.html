            <h2>Overview</h2>
            The Trove Sellers Platform enables anyone to curate and sell their own jewelry line - no inventory or jewelry experience required. Users are guided through an intuitive onboarding experience where they can select from a library of jewelry pieces, set prices, and edit the look and feel of their storefront. They are then free to market their jewelry collection on social media, via facebook ads, and to friends and family. Whereas most selling platforms require some "making" ability to actually create the objects to be sold, we sought to develop a selling solution that makes it such that logistics do not get in the way of peoples' entrepreneurial drive.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            I was the sole designer on this project and started with conducting initial user research all the way through the product's launch. I worked with stakeholders to research potential users, identify needs, and use those insights to guide product decisions. I also analyzed affilitate marketing platforms in order to identify pain points that we could improve upon, as well as drawing lessons that we could use to jumpstart our own platform.

            <h6>The Challenge</h6>
            <h2>New Territory</h2>
            The decision to explore this path came from a desire to find a scalable way to allow people to sell jewelry, as one might sell customizable t-shirts on other websites. However, neither I nor my team had any experience with selling platforms so I quickly dove into as many as possible, identifying key metrics for sellers such as profit model, up front costs, and how these platforms supported sellers.<br><br>
            We also spoke with staff at other online marketplaces to learn about their respective seller communities, looking for commonalities that we could leverage for our own product.

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            While researching competitors, we identified some major pain points that were common throughout different websites.
          </div>

                <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ahong-portfolio-images/no-inventory2.png" style="width:100%;">
              <h3>Inventory Risk</h3>
              Sellers had to purchase some quantity of the product up front which would require high minimums of units sold before a profit could be made.
              </div>
              <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-offset-0 col-md-4 img-text-block">

              <h3>Making Ability</h3>
              Marketplaces often focused on the abilities of makers, neglecting a large demographic of people who did not have crafting/making abilities.
              </div>
              <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-offset-0 col-md-4 img-text-block">

              <h3>Price Control</h3>
              Some marketplaces (especially for jewelry) required items to be sold at a fixed MSRP, putting a cap on unit margins.

            <h6>Design Process</h6>
            <h2>Easy Onboarding for Any User</h2>
            I wanted to focus on minimizing the amount of time and effort it took to launch a store, with the goal of optimizing for completion rates of having a storefront to give users a sense of ownership over the content that they would be trying to sell.
          </div>

          <div class="project-page text-section" style="margin-bottom:50;">
            <h3>Simplifying the Steps</h3>
            I mapped out numerous onboarding flows and sought to establish the minimum number of steps it would take to launch a storefront that sellers would feel confident advertising. I eventually settled on a flow that emphasized adding items to their collections with little friction and also requiring the bare minimum of information for sellers to launch their storefronts.

            <h6>Goals</h6>
            <h2>Be Free from Logistics</h2>
            The seller platform sought to be a place where individuals could choose from a catalog of premade jewelry pieces and add them to a storefront. Sellers would set their price then focus on marketing the jewelry to customers, and Trove would handle all of the packaging and shipping through a network of manufacturers and distributors around New York.<br><br>
            One of the major challenges of designing this platform was simultaneously balancing the practicalities of supply chain with that we discovered would be appealing to sellers. The initial version of the seller platform reflects limitations on the supply chain side, and was designed with growth of the catalog specifically in mind.
          </div>

          <div class="project-page text-section" style="margin-bottom:50;">
            <h3>Identifying Seller Needs</h3>
            Based on our competitive analysis, we wanted to make sure that the platform could guarantee no up front inventory cost for sellers, control over prices to reward sellers with being able to command a higher pricepoint for their goods, and empower anyone to sell.
          </div>

          <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>Getting the Word Out</h3>
            While conducting additional user research and developing a strategy for the MVP, I designed and released a launch page to start gathering e-mails. This would also give us a direct line of communication to more potential sellers to interview.

            <h6>Testing the Platform</h6>
            <h2>Onboarding High Value Sellers</h2>
            We worked to bring on influencers to the Sellers Platform to determine the viability of the product - whether sellers with organic audiences would be able to sell jewelry.

          </div>

          <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>Launching Additional Sellers</h3>
            As the platform is continually grown with new sellers, it will be possible to test the floor of how much reach a seller has to have to be able to sell jewelry within their own network/audience and beyond.
