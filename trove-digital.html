            <h2>Overview</h2>
            Trove is a customizable jewelry platform where users are able to discover, customize, and purchase their own unique jewelry pieces. The in-browser customization tools allows anyone to create unique pieces regardless of their experience level with design programs.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            I co-founded Trove alongside Brian Park and Tim Growney in 2015. In addition to designing the <a href="trove-physical.html" style="text-decoration:underline;">physical components of the product</a>, I was the sole designer of the brand, site, and UX from top to bottom along with continual testing, refinement, and new feature development. Being the only designer for the platform helped me to maintain a consistent user experience from initial awareness of the Trove brand all the way to receiving and wearing our custom jewelry.

            <h6>The Challenge</h6>
            <h2>Custom Jewelry for All</h2>
            The customized goods market grows yearly, especially with millenials who are looking for ways to express their individuality. In order to find unique jewelry, however, consumers usually work directly with a jewelry designer (which can be an extended and convoluted process). The purpose of the customization interface was to create a novel experience where any user would be able to customize their jewelry by making alterations to the shape, color, and size of jewelry and then purchase their unique items. This provided a series of challenges such as building an interface that was usable by people regardless of their exposure to design tools. In addition, the customizer needed to work seamlessly between web and mobile.

          <!-- <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>Ship or Sink</h3>
            As Trove's launch product, the Customizer needed to be built out enough to satisfy user needs and attract press for a young startup. However, this was balanced by the need to quickly test out the Customizer and refine its interactions and features over time. An ongoing conflict during this project was navigating and reconciling different internal opinions on what was considered shippable.
          </div>

          <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>Mobile First</h3>
            With the growth of mobile e-commerce, we knew early on that our mobile experience needed to be as free of friction points as possible. However, there are still very few 3D browser-based tools that are designed for and perform well on mobile. Throughout the design process, I had to ensure that both the desktop and mobile experiences were enjoyable and ultimately served users' needs.

            <h6>Research and Refine</h6>
            <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
            We first sought to understand our potential users - where they shop, the value they place on unique products, and whether or not they would customize jewelry for themselves or others. We soon discovered (and continued to discover with regular testing and customer feedback) that we expected two segments - users who wanted to express their own creativity, and users who wanted to find a unique gift. Both of these groups could then be segmented out with more specificity for ad retargeting and to inform product design choices. A third segment that we did not focus on was early adopters, primarily male, who were interested in the technology alone.
          </div>

          <!-- <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>"I'm not that creative"</h3>
            The prospect of customizing jewelry beyond a color choice or engraving seemed daunting to people who had not designed before. One of my major challenges was creating an interface and designing interactions that would instill creative confidence in users.
          </div>

          <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>The Blank Slate Conundrum</h3>
            Early on, we decided to build in significant constraints into how people could customize their jewelry. Especially as we were targeting a non-technical audience, our goal was to guide people towards aesthetically pleasing designs and prevent them from being frozen with fear at having too many options and unclear CTAs.
          </div>

          <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>Shopping with a Twist</h3>
            While the focus of the user research was on understanding how the Customizer could satisfy user needs and create exciting experiences, there was also the underlying need to frame everything within e-commerce and determine whether these user compulsions would convert to purchases.

            <h6>Design Process</h6>
            <h2>Beginning with E-Commerce</h2>
            In parallel with the development of the 3D Customizer, I also needed to design the e-commerce portion of the Trove website that the Customizer would then connect to. Because of file export requirements and some other functionality related to the Customizer, we were forced to build an e-commerce platform from scratch.
            <br><br>
            I gathered all of the user research and turned those learnings into the strategic direction of the website - both its e-commerce and customization components - using a range of tools, some of which are described below:
          </div>
        <div class="project-page text-full-width">
              <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-md-5 img-text-block">
                <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ahong-portfolio-images/concept-map.png" style="width:100%;">
              <h3>Concept Mapping</h3>
              One of the major challenges was determining how the customizer would fit within a standard e-commerce site flow - what options would be made available at what points, and how to allow for people to buy customized products from others when they didn't want to make something themselves.
              </div>
              <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-offset-0 col-md-5 img-text-block">
                <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ahong-portfolio-images/paper-wireframe.jpg" style="width:100%;">
              <h3>Paper Prototypes</h3>
              My personal workflow involves a lot of sketching on paper for low fidelity prototypes to focus on the information architecture and flow of a design without getting distracted by aesthetics in Photoshop or other programs.
              </div>
              <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-offset-1"></div>

              <h3>Mock Ups and Interactive Prototype Site</h3>
              Because of development resource constraints (with our only engineer at the time working on the back end of the site), I quickly went from high fidelity mockups to building a clickable prototype site for the e-commerce component of the Trove platform.
              </div>
              <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-offset-0 col-md-5 img-text-block">

              <h3>Usability Testing and Reworking</h3>
              I conducted numerous tests in order to track site navigation and ensure that users would be able to find the customization tools and that the tools fit into the users' mental models of how to move through a standard e-commerce site.

            <h6>Designing the Customizer</h6>
            <h2>(You the Real) MVP</h2>
            Once the e-commerce portion of the site was at a workable place, I focused on designing the Customizer and making sure that it fit seamlessly with the rest of the Trove site.
          </div>

          <div class="project-page img-full-width" style="margin-top:0;">

          </div>

          <div class="project-page text-section">
            After multiple rounds of wireframes, mockups, user tests, technical discussions, and refinements, I eventually landed on an interface for the customizer that presented users with a limited range of options and placed the jewelry front and center. The design also emphasized the collaborative element of the design process on Trove, where we had intended for users to be able to customize off of each others' designs to create a continual design narrative between modified objects.
          </div>

          

          <!-- <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>Usability For Everyone</h3>
            As soon as we had our MVP, we ran tests with different age groups and comfort levels with technology to gauge how users would interact with the Customizer and to further refine the design. The entire team was required to watch the recordings of the usability tests in order to ingrain the need to think about the user above all else. This was an early effort in establishing the design culture of Trove from project managers to engineering.
          </div>

          <!-- <div class="project-page text-section">
            <h3>Creating a testing platform</h3>
            For several business reasons, we could not make major alterations to the Customizer for a significant period of time. In order to conduct the research necessary to improve the product, we built out a user onboarding flow that walked users through our Customizer and also sent them a free 3D-printed nylon version of their customized jewelry at the end. By having this separately segmented user flow, we were able to run A/B tests to test layout, copy, and other elements to optimize completion and return rates.

            <h6>Iterate, then Iterate some more</h6>
            <h2>Starting Again</h2>
            After several rounds of testing, we realized that the customization interface was still too complicated for older demographics. We sought to create a Customizer that provided a linear path through the numerous decisions that are possible with our custom jewelry. Each step would prompt users to continue on to a next step and provide incremental rewards to move users towards task completion.

          <div class="project-page text-section" style="margin-bottom:50px;">
            <h3>Step by Step</h3>
            I eventually landed on a Customizer that divides up options into individual steps. This was intended to break up the cognitive load of having multiple tasks before checkout and reduce perceived friction points in the customization process.
          </div>

            <h6>Reflections</h6>
            <h2>Launching our first product</h2>
            As the first major product launch for a new founding team, the Customizer proved to be an invaluable learning experience. Internally, we learned how to effectively communicate with one another and discuss ideal products versus feasibility given short timelines. We began the ongoing process of deeply understanding our users and continue to refine this knowledge in order to continue to build better products.<br><br>
            While it is drilled into UX designers to test, iterate, and refine, going through this process at a rapidly moving startup truly brought to light the urgency and importance of this process. Our success relies heavily on this design process and continual desire to explore and learn how we can innovate in ways that benefit our audience.
